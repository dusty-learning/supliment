# DOM Manipulation

This is a key component to the basic starting blocks for a dynamic website/application.

I will be covering mainly vanilla javascript here since it's the better route to take now for starting out, and overall it's better if for some reason you decide to not use a framework. (Like beginner apps or practice!)
