# Elm

Elm is a functional language that technically branches from and compiles down to JavaScript at the core however it is so much more than that and so much more powerful

Elm adds a strictly type based system, a lot stronger than something like `TypeScript`

## Benefits

- Elm is it's own language, compiler, and framework all built into one
- It has a very strong emphasis on simplicity, ease-of-use, and quality tooling
- Statically typed with type inference
- Allows us to write well-architectured, declarative code
- Had it's own built in package manager
- Immutable data and functions must be pure
- No Runtime Exceptions
- Amazing performance
- Enforced Semantic Versioning
